# C++ based model inference using TensorFlow

This repository provides some basic examples of how to execute an exported TensorFlow graph in C++ for inference.

## Examples

There are two different examples included:

+ Attention-OCR C++ Inference (https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/attention_ocr)
+ Custom LSTM model based C++ Inference on Android using JNI

For pretrained classifiers, use the **freeze_graph.py** script present in the utils directory for exporting the graph.pb file.
